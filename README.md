# Vanguard Standards
These are the different standards used by the Vanguard Team.

## Project Naming Standards
### Common Rules
- Prefix projects with an indicator (see below for list of prefixes)
- Use - (dash) for spaces (e.g. vanguard solar app would be vanguard-solar-app)
- Do not use CamelCase for project names

### Prefix Standards
| Prefix        | Purpose           | Example  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------ |
| _auth_     | Identity, Authentication, Authorization | auth-overview |
| _aws_      | Amazon Web Services based projects | aws-config |
| _bc_       | Basecamp projects | bc-basecampone |
| _cf_       | Cloud Foundry projects | cf-config |
| _du_        | Digital Utility related | du-transactional-energy |
| _epic_      | EPIC-related | epic-2-26 |
