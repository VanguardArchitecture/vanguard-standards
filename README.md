# Vanguard Standards
These are the different standards used by the Vanguard Team.

## Project Naming Standards
### Common Rules
- Prefix projects with an indicator (see below for list of prefixes)
- Use - for spaces (e.g. vanguard solar app would be vanguard-solar-app)
- Do not use CamelCase for project names

### Prefix Standards
| Prefix        | Purpose           | Example  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------ |
| _auth_     | Identity, Authentication, Authorization | auth-overview |
| _bc_       | Basecamp projects | bc-basecampone |
| _vsa_      | Vanguard Solar App      |   vsa-front-end-html |
| _x_        | eXploration       |    x-ibeacon |
| _vanguard_ | general Vanguard information | vanguard-overview |
