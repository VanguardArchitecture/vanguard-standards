# Vanguard Standards
These are the different standards used by the Vanguard Team.

## Project Naming Standards
### Common Rules
- Prefix projects with an indicator (see below for list of prefixes)
- Use - (dash) for spaces (e.g. vanguard solar app would be vanguard-solar-app)
- Do not use CamelCase for project names

If there are several projects that roll up to an overall project, create an overall project. Use the overall project to roll-up issues using Zenhub.

For example:

_Overall Project_

**Vanguard**

__Sub-projects__
* vanguard-papers**
* vanguard-standards**
* vanguard-blog**
* vanguard-columbo**

Github issues for each project are created at the project level. If there are product-level issues (Strategies, Roadmaps etc), those are kept at the overall project level.

### Prefix Standards

## Toolchains
While not speicifcally standards, these are more guideline based. The first and foremost goal is to enable productivity. These are tools we've found to be useful.
