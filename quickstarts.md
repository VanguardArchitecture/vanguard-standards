# Introduction
Quickstarts are used as instructions for someone going hands-on with the project / technology.

Consider the quickstarts as stepping stones in learning or as part of a basecamp. Use them as ways to tell someone how to get a working version of the project.

# Format and Headings
The default format for a quickstart is github markdown.

Here are the common sections:
1. Purpose
2. Environment Requirements
3. Step-by-step
4. Troubleshooting (optional)
5. Where Next (optional)


# Location of the Quickstart
Store the quickstart instructions in either the README.md file or create a QUICKSTART.md file, depending on the complexity of the instructions.
